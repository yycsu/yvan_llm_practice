56,紫金山实验室为什么要使用仿真平台进行有效性测试？,我们使用机器学习、图神经网络等人工智能技术，对网络的历史和实时数据进行分析和学习，以便预测在未来的某个时间段，哪些网络链路将会发生流量拥塞。”陈佳琦介绍，通过智能路由控制算法，团队可以在拥塞发生前就对流量进行分流，从而保障网络传输质量。“由于你在现网上直接去做任何配置，都会影响到其他业务的通断。所以我们把这些策略应用在仿真平台，进行有效性测验。”黄兵明补充说。这样的好处显而易见。他同时强调，对于现有的网络升级改造不是一蹴而就的，需要结合网络的现状以及未来网络的发展趋势，潜心研究，制定合理的优化方案，最终使得网络朝着未来网络新型体系架2021年，时任紫金山实验室综合试验平台中心主任侯春雨，敏锐地意识到了这一发展趋势和巨大潜力。在他看来，实验室偏向技术研究，企业偏向实际应用，两者正好互补。同时，双方坚持产教融合培养与数字经济发展高度契合的卓越工程师人才，为新时期,"0.002983,0.012276,-0.05176,0.01605,0.03014,0.0416,0.02126,-0.0368,-0.003986,-0.010506,-0.002691,-0.006485,-0.0261,0.002296,0.00884,0.004055,0.01883,-0.001497,0.01321,0.013145,0.03598,-0.035,-0.03964,-0.0686,0.02675,0.02025,-0.00431,-0.009995,0.0742,0.005898,0.005127,-0.02501,-0.00959,0.0487,0.02333,0.0038,-0.00978,-0.02625,0.00869,0.02626,0.01581,-0.01347,0.00476,-0.05237,-0.01004,0.04996,-0.0369,-0.0455,0.00751,-0.014435,-0.03049,0.02835,0.1072,-0.02502,-0.01415,-0.00591,0.01611,-0.035,-0.007446,-0.03912,0.03665,0.12067,0.01642,-0.00915,0.00716,-0.007446,0.02052,-0.05255,0.06616,0.02187,0.01416,0.00888,-0.0365,0.0163,0.05142,-0.01406,-0.01743,-0.00511,-0.0375,0.03052,-0.01898,-0.02638,0.05536,0.009796,4.76e-05,-0.03052,0.02037,0.477,-0.02748,-0.03946,-0.02167,-0.05194,-0.03397,-0.00261,0.0265,-0.005856,0.01765,-0.00772,0.006035,-0.04712,-0.02567,-0.005417,-0.01915,-0.01515,-0.02853,0.002708,-0.0184,-0.02141,0.005554,0.02527,-0.01686,0.02661,0.006714,0.03226,0.03488,-0.002287,-0.03775,0.00847,0.000704,0.000988,-0.00989,0.02559,0.0097,-0.02242,-0.02878,-0.02002,-0.02316,-0.0662,0.03333,-0.006775,0.02296,-0.02405,0.04346,-0.03677,0.02147,-0.01236,-0.0508,-0.0342,0.01408,-0.02914,0.003437,-0.03062,-0.0275,0.002377,0.0361,-0.0387,-0.01256,0.04358,-0.0235,0.00352,-0.007694,0.002117,-0.02382,0.02017,0.01616,-0.02504,0.01718,-0.00773,0.03268,0.002272,0.03065,0.01441,-0.00898,0.00583,-0.01668,-0.02652,-0.005505,-0.01773,0.0144,0.02287,-0.056,0.03482,-0.06573,-0.05576,-0.00179,-0.02028,0.01839,0.0377,0.0333,0.04004,0.00573,-0.02815,0.00361,-0.004078,-0.03766,0.02707,0.0176,0.002274,0.03983,-0.03198,-0.03165,-0.03387,0.02834,0.0317,0.0104,0.02318,-0.02411,0.02534,-0.04282,0.003088,0.02287,-0.02385,-0.04456,-0.006035,0.01892,0.006233,2.784e-05,0.01542,-0.0001923,0.0262,0.0007186,0.03293,0.03482,-0.02153,-0.002054,-0.03705,0.001804,0.003181,-0.03412,0.0304,0.03522,0.0084,-0.01941,-0.00922,-0.03146,-0.003145,0.00824,-0.003967,-0.04556,0.01053,-0.01018,-0.01746,0.05154,0.0169,0.01196,0.05804,-0.02042,-0.0356,-0.04608,-0.03287,-0.0787,0.015274,0.00865,-0.0283,0.02579,0.02443,-0.04807,-0.007835,-0.01216,0.01544,0.0405,0.02438,-0.01683,-0.03026,-0.01701,-0.01657,-0.02667,0.006836,0.005714,-0.002556,-0.03876,-0.06396,-0.02606,-0.006798,0.002792,0.01865,0.02808,0.0185,-0.0006785,0.01657,0.008545,-0.01253,-0.02942,-0.01843,-0.006516,-0.00725,-0.0441,-0.01746,0.02122,0.010544,-0.01913,0.002657,0.00171,-0.02347,0.01065,-0.0135,-0.010864,-0.0137,-0.0331,-0.01952,0.01892,0.02766,-0.0326,-0.02814,0.02968,0.0343,-0.0172,-0.01622,0.005543,0.00534,0.0249,0.02686,-0.01238,-0.04114,0.003166,-0.00606,-0.00965,0.02025,0.001649,0.04532,0.03384,0.008545,-0.00631,-0.0003865,-0.02127,-0.03433,0.04276,0.01455,0.01253,0.01137,-0.006462,0.02304,-0.007267,0.02824,-0.00474,0.00471,0.004456,0.04688,0.00998,0.02014,0.0444,0.0003843,-0.01524,-0.00525,-0.05225,0.0004506,0.04623,0.003752,-0.01461,0.0623,0.01645,0.010826,-0.00475,-0.007965,-0.03049,0.002073,0.01718,-0.01674,-0.014694,0.05988,0.006386,-0.01831,0.03052,-0.00921,-0.03723,-0.0477,0.01063,-0.01797,0.005116,0.0267,0.000983,0.0189,-0.02554,0.01567,0.0526,-0.01688,-0.04105,-0.02003,-0.03345,0.03323,0.0539,0.012405,0.03354,0.0222,0.001612,-0.04587,-0.02557,0.02786,-0.038,0.02414,0.00344,0.014824,0.03732,0.0223,-0.02924,-0.014824,0.00385,-0.001722,0.001788,-0.00983,-0.0514,0.00208,0.00298,-0.004337,-0.06,0.01918,-0.00407,-0.02013,-0.006554,-0.01869,0.006397,-0.02034,-0.001212,-0.002779,-0.004303,0.0010605,0.01874,-0.03177,0.01619,0.002895,0.0105,0.010345,-0.04514,-0.02722,0.00597,0.01355,0.013824,-0.013214,-0.04395,0.02554,0.014824,0.0391,-0.03622,-0.01453,-0.02151,0.01082,-0.001993,0.01262,0.01132,-0.01456,0.00436,0.002226,0.02145,0.008766,-0.008995,-0.0038,-0.00218,-0.02438,0.00552,-0.0119,-0.0364,-0.02216,-0.0414,-0.00475,-0.01368,0.01224,-0.01831,-0.00787,-0.01286,-0.02515,0.03815,-0.03708,-0.001978,-0.01053,0.0704,0.00874,0.005554,0.005905,0.01585,-0.007774,0.012886,9.15e-05,-0.0423,-0.0462,-0.03555,0.03004,-0.0656,0.071,-0.01086,-0.01773,0.01701,-0.05124,-0.01918,-0.004406,-0.04245,0.01659,-0.02246,-0.05374,-0.00416,0.02173,-0.06976,0.02539,-0.006817,-0.010635,0.00814,0.03091,-0.004368,-0.02219,0.005108,-0.02913,0.01903,-0.01633,-0.003036,-6.21e-05,0.01112,-0.02205,-0.01089,-0.02155,-0.0823,0.00875,-0.00785,0.01608,-0.006664,0.03055,0.0001602,-0.0587,-0.03098,0.02737,-0.02007,0.02364,0.02025,-0.002924,-0.02924,0.0111,-0.06113,-0.003735,0.03046,0.01234,0.03827,0.02055,0.0265,-0.02351,0.0006638,-0.0376,0.01139,-0.06003,0.0246,0.03476,-0.00934,0.0002234,0.002518,-0.01497,0.007286,-0.0329

93,2022年泰安肥城联通为听（视）障人士设计了哪两款通信产品？,因此，他们精心打造了“畅听王卡·无障碍通话助手”与“畅视王卡”，这两款专为听（视）障人士设计的通信产品，如同两把钥匙，为他们打开了通往信息世界的大门。与语音的即时互转。这一功能的突破，意味着听障朋友在通话时，不再受限于无声的世界。无论是远方的亲人问候，还是日常的社交需求，都能通过文字与语音的流畅转换，实现无缝沟通。而电话练习功能的引入，则像是为听障朋友提供了一个私人的通信训练场，通过模拟拨打，他们可以逐步提高自己的无障碍通话能力，增强社交自信。帮助老年人及残障群体跨越数字鸿沟，不仅是社会治理精细化的体现，更是社会文明进步的标志。泰安肥城联通的专属套餐，以实际行动践行了“以人民为中心”的发展思想，展现了企业高度的社会责任感。2022年，推出“银龄专享”服务计划共十大举措，涵盖便捷服务、温情陪伴、专属产品、反诈提醒、智慧帮手、智趣生活等，累计服务银龄客户超过70,"0.002182,0.006855,-0.00928,-0.00977,0.01874,0.03084,0.01807,-0.0256,-0.02681,0.012024,0.0346,0.00708,0.01822,-0.01772,0.01704,0.02515,0.01572,-0.00852,-0.0005836,0.00461,0.05518,-0.04443,-0.03006,-0.01027,0.0462,0.004044,-0.001688,0.0324,0.05124,-0.00947,-0.00252,-0.01293,0.003483,0.01855,0.0384,-0.01159,0.0038,-0.015335,0.03864,0.01833,0.0276,-0.02313,0.0203,0.00837,-0.05786,0.02504,0.006283,-0.02649,0.000976,0.02077,-0.01486,-0.003897,0.0735,-0.02635,0.007355,-0.00883,-0.00238,-0.01466,0.009125,-0.03708,0.01424,0.09973,0.04498,-0.01245,-0.01028,0.04645,-0.004234,-0.0536,0.0725,0.0007544,-0.00589,-0.02103,-0.0237,0.03207,0.03387,-0.03162,-0.032,-0.0713,-0.05576,0.06305,-0.03348,-0.03424,0.02249,-0.00329,0.02078,-0.03488,0.02538,0.4612,0.00759,-0.011826,0.006138,-0.01368,-0.02983,-0.03598,0.02502,-0.03833,0.01189,0.03387,-0.0251,-0.0333,-0.000767,-0.007835,-0.000932,-0.04065,-0.0211,0.02834,-0.004272,0.03934,-0.01698,0.03009,-0.010345,0.01454,0.0462,-0.008415,0.01152,-0.0005145,-0.01129,0.0346,-0.012474,0.01593,-0.02972,0.08105,0.00077,-0.0123,-0.012924,0.00612,0.00934,-0.039,-0.001745,-0.02036,0.0405,-0.02905,0.05377,-0.04755,0.02419,0.03806,-0.0517,0.00276,0.01894,-0.01921,0.0502,-0.01662,-0.007397,0.03143,-0.002758,-0.05334,-0.01395,-0.0045,-0.05496,0.0089,-0.021,-0.00791,0.02126,0.01173,0.011,0.04947,0.00659,-0.01685,0.001118,0.006004,0.002909,0.00879,0.01833,0.004612,-0.0679,-0.01685,0.01451,0.0001626,-0.001276,0.02008,-0.03915,0.01112,-0.062,-0.03012,-0.011215,-0.00626,-0.02054,0.05917,0.03604,0.02158,0.02135,0.001285,0.03555,0.0202,-0.02742,0.04175,-0.002876,0.01102,-0.0267,-0.02206,-0.02112,-0.03867,-0.03156,0.03693,-0.02309,0.0168,-0.03378,0.0302,-0.01836,-0.02686,0.02873,-0.0206,-0.03177,-0.02882,-0.02597,-0.006336,0.02226,0.03073,-0.0129,0.03516,-0.00961,0.06793,-0.02658,0.004467,0.010994,-0.03983,-0.00913,0.01732,-0.0394,-0.04236,0.0503,-0.02222,-0.0382,-0.02979,-0.0344,-0.01819,-0.01663,0.002117,-0.04147,0.03062,-0.02039,-0.02573,0.04495,0.01736,0.01953,0.05133,-0.01845,0.001672,-0.02693,-0.03592,-0.02028,-0.0318,0.0398,0.00722,0.02858,0.0407,-0.05414,-0.04672,0.003485,-0.0307,0.009026,-0.03116,-0.0465,0.02576,-0.007057,-0.01517,-0.01573,0.002378,-0.05603,-0.01201,-0.01924,-0.05365,-0.01523,-0.00406,0.02032,0.01968,0.02373,0.01788,0.015564,0.02145,0.02193,-0.02296,0.001744,-0.02005,-0.00433,0.004887,-0.0446,0.012054,0.008835,-0.01552,-0.0608,-0.03735,-0.00933,-0.004135,0.02106,0.004623,-0.001637,0.02614,-0.01791,-0.03387,-0.02078,0.05234,-0.04202,-0.073,0.02853,0.01256,0.02496,0.000378,0.02959,-0.01478,0.03827,-0.01015,0.06604,-0.009026,-0.01478,-0.007023,-0.02055,0.002779,-0.03146,0.010765,0.02115,-0.008484,-0.04086,-0.0304,0.002865,-0.004093,-0.01203,-0.0295,-0.006035,0.00266,-0.00748,-0.02255,0.001233,0.002047,-0.01168,0.01851,-0.01756,-0.01797,-0.01971,0.03412,0.03,0.01793,-0.02843,0.02507,0.011856,0.0394,0.05023,0.00847,-0.013824,0.0326,0.0773,-0.03067,-0.012886,-0.03046,-0.0166,0.0462,-0.01851,-0.04156,-0.0332,0.04535,-0.00971,-0.00623,-0.02528,-0.01364,0.01617,-0.07574,0.01201,0.009636,-0.01614,0.0664,0.04846,0.007835,-0.05518,-0.009285,0.02171,-0.00915,0.011154,0.007355,-0.005383,0.03354,0.01228,0.0371,0.02022,0.02167,-0.01425,-0.01694,-0.01976,0.02661,-0.01105,0.01391,-0.02429,-0.00657,0.0166,-0.0156,-0.03613,0.006687,-0.00838,-0.01064,0.01255,-0.008064,-0.0346,0.0007334,0.003765,0.04437,-0.0088,0.02464,-0.00637,-0.03442,-0.00921,0.03056,0.01061,0.03152,-0.008415,-0.051,0.03268,-0.006283,0.0088,0.00719,-0.05438,0.0284,-0.01451,-0.03143,-0.00873,-0.01212,0.01634,0.04385,0.006474,-0.04892,-0.0235,0.009254,-0.02756,0.02983,-0.0646,0.01308,-0.01569,-0.01431,0.01295,0.002491,-0.02202,-0.062,0.01707,0.001937,-0.00724,0.02657,-0.02132,-0.0324,-0.002344,0.00867,-0.008606,-0.006268,0.01953,0.001504,-0.02202,-0.03983,-0.062,0.05334,-0.02425,-0.04163,0.0144,-0.006023,0.02872,0.001288,-0.01654,-0.0002148,0.04547,0.015434,-0.01714,0.01453,-0.04166,0.03014,0.03336,0.01643,-0.05472,-0.03314,-0.04135,0.05243,-0.00855,0.03867,0.04315,-0.011215,0.03894,-0.05353,-0.0206,-0.002895,-0.0778,-0.000154,-0.002457,-0.03732,0.0383,0.0362,-0.0454,0.01843,-0.03665,-0.003016,0.01196,0.0286,0.01046,-0.005928,0.00814,-0.02106,-0.022,-0.01732,-0.02644,-0.02135,-0.01513,-0.05725,-0.03998,0.02264,0.01363,-0.02623,-0.01976,0.00719,-0.01884,0.03687,-0.002197,-0.010155,-0.04117,-0.006268,-0.03973,0.01231,-0.02176,-0.04065,0.01022,0.01686,-0.008865,0.0687,0.02429,-0.01569,0.04218,0.01542,0.008484,0.00511,0.00904,-0.02406,-0.0649,-0.0522,0.03223,-0.01284,-0.01805,-0.0394,0.01752,0.007233,0.002232,0.00489,-0.00365

95,上海联通北区分公司设立的“共产党员工程”明确了什么具体目标？,具体而言，上海联通北区分公司通过强化基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用，优化党员队伍结构，提升党员队伍素质，确保党建工作在划小单元中落地生根、开花结果。同时，公司还注重将党建工作与经营工作紧密结合，通过设立党员责任区、党员示范岗等方式，引导党员在业务发展中勇挑重担、争当先锋，形成“一名党员一面旗”的良好氛围。它不仅承载着将公司各项经营目标细化至最小执行单元的重任，更是确保战略意图精准触达、有效执行的“最后一公里”。在这一背景下，上海联通北区分公司深刻认识到，划小单元的党建工作质量，不仅是衡量区分公司党建工作成效的标尺，更是驱动公司整体高质量发展的核心动力之一。为此，上海联通北区分公司积极响应并创新实践“六个一”工作机制，这一机制旨在通过一系列具体而细致的措施，将党建工作深度融入公司改革与发展的全过程，实现“党建、改革、发展”三者的一体化同步推进。在这一理念的引领下，公,"-0.02252,0.01055,-0.02252,-0.02356,-0.01996,0.03394,-0.01087,-0.05502,0.00709,0.01417,0.01217,0.02141,0.004574,-0.006676,-0.0166,-0.003057,-0.014084,0.01697,-0.003723,0.04294,0.01489,-0.01249,-0.03111,-0.01952,-0.03885,0.0004294,-0.0372,0.02512,0.01921,0.02023,-0.0351,-0.00992,0.004677,0.0528,0.0695,0.03162,-0.04565,-0.02492,0.01117,-0.005062,-0.01917,-0.03117,-0.006794,-0.002104,-0.0313,0.04114,-0.0656,-0.02957,-0.010544,-0.01706,-0.0566,0.03232,0.0754,-0.001941,-0.0282,0.04327,-0.05118,-0.03696,-0.02516,0.01017,0.01441,0.1066,-0.005917,0.006218,-0.06058,0.04523,0.02075,-0.0408,0.06155,-0.00973,0.002754,0.01272,-0.02579,0.01387,0.05438,-0.0313,-0.001612,-0.01502,-0.0751,0.004,-0.001615,-0.03555,0.01151,-0.002028,-0.004463,-0.0219,0.0293,0.4395,-0.001236,-0.02864,-0.01242,-0.0472,-0.04034,-0.02246,0.00775,-0.04236,-0.012085,-0.011345,-0.04736,-0.04248,0.01878,-0.03183,0.02078,0.00986,0.00617,-0.01106,-0.01545,0.00674,0.00706,0.0345,-0.001275,0.01547,-0.00646,0.05737,0.00494,0.02074,-0.0373,0.0693,0.002888,0.01788,-0.00886,0.008865,0.0006495,-0.02473,-0.0304,0.0559,0.03217,-0.0741,0.01674,-0.003023,0.006607,-0.01417,0.01091,-0.00226,-0.01797,0.000993,-0.0359,-0.03745,0.03616,0.003191,0.03983,-0.0411,0.005287,-0.0004041,0.03284,0.01709,0.02383,0.03296,-0.01538,-0.01017,-0.02727,-0.03403,-0.02446,-0.03613,0.005745,-0.02257,0.0141,0.01839,0.007607,-0.05243,0.02985,0.0001304,-0.008316,-0.01567,0.001287,-0.02869,-0.0236,-0.01252,0.0164,0.03305,-0.057,0.04077,-0.0213,-0.004528,-0.0153,-0.04187,-0.03458,0.007763,0.05887,0.01883,0.02507,-0.01938,0.00922,0.02985,-0.01799,-0.005024,0.01761,0.0108,-0.005123,0.00987,-0.04562,-0.0163,0.03442,0.02766,0.02711,0.03217,0.01128,0.03033,-0.03009,0.06903,0.01092,0.01935,0.00398,-0.059,-0.0001311,0.02205,0.00337,0.004707,0.02434,0.02704,-0.001537,0.01721,0.01102,-0.00408,0.0003936,-0.03995,-0.02951,-0.01547,-0.0014515,-0.01089,0.0373,-0.003502,0.01657,0.007187,-0.02875,0.0161,0.007565,0.01689,-0.0422,0.01189,-0.00954,0.0028,-0.01053,0.03815,0.0387,0.014305,0.000966,0.003126,-0.02519,-0.05496,-0.03336,0.0169,0.00957,-0.01563,0.01622,0.02371,-0.01857,-0.02187,0.04947,-0.03503,0.01611,-0.02654,0.03232,-0.04126,-0.0006075,-0.00891,-0.0139,0.03534,0.01865,0.01619,0.01045,-0.04062,-0.0275,-0.01352,0.04263,-0.008675,0.02206,0.02354,0.02081,-0.00673,0.02977,0.02803,-0.002905,-0.02017,-0.0452,-0.036,-0.088,-0.01988,0.01038,0.01095,-0.01917,-0.02142,-0.01617,-0.03848,0.03702,-0.02518,-0.03476,-0.00949,-0.0385,-0.05035,-0.014046,0.041,-0.01904,-0.04285,0.02199,-0.00741,-0.03555,0.01718,-0.01426,0.02048,0.05383,0.02,0.06775,-0.01755,0.01069,0.01651,-0.01765,0.03156,-0.01484,0.03537,-0.001613,0.00518,0.0205,-0.05408,-0.04758,-0.0113,0.0214,-0.01701,-0.004276,0.02977,0.02718,0.03226,-0.03848,0.013336,-0.02338,-0.0048,-0.0171,0.0365,0.02827,0.03204,0.0233,0.0226,0.02266,-0.03032,0.01549,0.04715,0.03204,-0.01303,-0.0427,0.00274,0.01073,0.00181,-0.02933,-0.008385,-0.00996,0.01886,-0.01915,-0.010025,-0.003807,0.04547,0.00972,0.02487,0.04062,-0.02145,-0.00961,0.00926,0.01851,-0.00893,-0.02467,0.0415,-0.006405,0.02081,-0.03073,-0.04642,0.005028,0.002886,-0.03397,-0.02681,-0.03513,0.0178,0.01999,-0.00863,-0.02554,0.02919,-0.01279,-0.04404,-0.04932,0.04266,-0.05307,-0.01236,0.02496,0.027,0.02184,0.0082,0.0021,0.00806,0.01545,-0.0374,0.0226,-0.01784,-0.04926,0.01389,-0.01584,0.003872,-0.02185,0.02802,-0.01502,-0.02654,0.0223,0.0844,0.02202,-0.01073,-0.02495,-0.02296,0.02576,-0.02486,0.03915,-0.02222,-0.003187,-0.010185,0.008064,-0.0187,-0.02464,-0.04144,-0.003242,0.02824,-0.0221,-0.01535,-0.05453,0.004517,-0.00731,0.01446,-0.05106,-0.00523,-0.005688,-0.003372,0.0438,0.002502,-0.014824,-0.01097,0.008865,0.04266,0.002556,0.03827,-0.01153,-0.03806,-0.01756,0.00282,-0.03064,0.03604,-0.00141,-0.00912,-0.00949,0.01337,0.02216,0.06616,-0.02078,0.01991,-0.01987,-0.03522,0.02045,-0.0413,-0.02893,-0.013916,0.06073,-0.02708,-0.02475,0.02583,-0.0114,0.015526,-0.007374,0.000871,-0.05096,-0.03894,-0.01285,0.02818,-0.03056,0.0165,0.02208,0.01117,0.0719,-0.004383,0.02951,-0.006668,-0.03522,0.000942,-0.006645,-0.05322,0.0231,-0.02588,-0.0185,0.04034,-0.03354,0.02858,0.01668,0.01906,-0.00484,-0.02667,0.02039,0.01053,-0.01894,0.03522,-0.02164,-0.005527,0.03198,-0.02466,-0.04355,-0.02823,-0.03827,-0.0575,-0.05203,0.002132,-0.0351,0.0331,-0.001598,0.002216,-0.04446,0.02061,-0.01753,-0.00365,0.00841,-0.03674,-0.0508,-0.00333,-0.0655,0.0223,-0.001179,0.01672,0.02441,0.0076,0.02814,-0.00358,0.01807,0.01764,0.002779,-0.0528,0.00563,-0.00499,-0.01299,-0.02263,-0.0307,0.0347,0.001365,0.02283,-0.01622,-0.013855,0.011
