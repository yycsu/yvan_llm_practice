5G技术在北京冬奥会中的应用将带来哪些特点？,5G-A基站采用多载波聚合、超级上传等多项创新技术，将传输效率，为亚运会期间创新智能应用提供强有力的网络保障。2022年北京冬奥会提出了“科技冬奥”的愿景，这一愿景不仅仅是关于运动的精彩呈现，更是对未来技术的预见和应用。在北京冬奥会、全国两会、党的二十大等重大活动网络安全保障服务中，实现零事故、零失误、零投诉。奥林匹克广播服务公司也称赞，北京冬奥会是历届冬奥会转播基础设施质量最高的一次，“每一个场地都有非常稳定的5G网络”。北京冬奥组委将携手中国联通加强北京冬奥会与国内外各界的相联相通，努力打造智慧冬奥、科技冬奥；同时，也会努力搭建推广平台，提供良好服务，使中国联通充分获得奥运品牌带来的广泛收益，助力企业更好发展。,"-0.00547,-0.01368,-0.0309,0.01016,0.01917,0.02377,-0.011894,-0.0691,-0.02496,0.003597,0.02403,0.02417,-0.02309,-0.01714,0.01785,-0.001085,0.02438,-0.014336,0.01528,0.0007777,0.0747,-0.01339,-0.01431,-0.01591,0.00758,-0.01566,-0.01837,0.01176,0.05624,0.01293,-0.01338,-0.03885,0.01171,0.03336,0.0318,0.00734,0.000635,-0.01078,0.02637,0.03275,0.01964,-0.010574,0.02963,-0.0544,-0.03998,0.03876,-0.000801,-0.00812,0.006966,0.02527,-0.02568,-0.018,0.04718,0.01387,0.001304,0.003252,0.02347,-0.0086,-0.0438,-0.0465,-0.03296,0.1134,0.01273,-0.01421,0.001816,0.007812,0.01128,-0.0725,0.07245,0.03156,0.03235,0.0209,-0.03494,0.003553,0.0145,-0.02356,0.0148,-0.0392,-0.0506,0.04068,-0.012634,-0.05942,0.02258,0.02393,0.01041,-0.0423,0.03564,0.4326,0.01866,-0.02818,0.01354,-0.07947,-0.0398,-0.01293,0.02211,-0.02625,-0.01189,-0.00845,0.01256,-0.06647,-0.0183,-0.001506,0.02429,-0.01756,-0.007553,-0.00939,0.0001209,0.00597,-0.012344,0.04858,-0.014336,0.0276,0.00865,-0.004463,-0.010544,0.01698,-0.003838,0.01223,-0.002682,8.655e-05,-0.03894,0.05334,0.03114,0.007156,0.02121,0.001326,-0.01712,-0.0619,0.01293,0.02908,0.02177,-0.0708,0.0231,-0.03476,-0.00927,0.001309,-0.06335,-0.03326,-0.005535,-0.00548,0.02777,-0.03038,-0.004223,-0.001136,0.02946,-0.01634,0.001929,0.0502,-0.0792,0.01706,-0.03117,-0.001422,-0.02513,-0.003632,0.03613,-0.0373,0.03467,-0.00933,0.00728,0.02109,-0.03084,0.002361,0.00785,0.005405,-0.04996,0.015434,-0.02069,-0.01209,0.00669,0.0349,-0.0623,0.00432,-0.013626,-0.04727,0.01587,-0.0301,-0.001244,0.0241,0.02615,0.01912,-0.01468,-0.03183,0.0494,0.04373,-0.0169,0.03784,0.02603,0.02162,0.002985,-0.00456,-0.003342,-0.04495,-0.002403,0.03336,-0.02185,0.03004,-0.009674,0.01492,-0.01921,0.007866,0.01102,-0.0272,-0.006577,-0.03238,0.02377,0.01088,-0.02176,0.01085,0.01276,0.00888,0.00486,0.04404,0.0338,-0.0494,-0.015076,-0.006916,-0.02249,0.03485,-0.01935,0.02371,0.0201,-0.05307,-0.0061,-0.003176,-0.01582,-0.00626,-0.005424,-0.01371,-0.02481,0.01842,-0.0093,-0.01111,0.0409,-0.00967,0.01721,0.0342,0.002607,0.00964,-0.02748,-0.03546,-0.04565,0.006863,-0.006054,-0.0353,-0.003508,0.04803,-0.04755,-0.0512,0.009415,0.001655,0.010635,-0.02051,-0.02531,-0.011604,0.0226,-0.01081,-0.05402,0.01332,-0.02554,0.02068,-0.001045,-0.01897,-0.03247,-0.03638,-0.003729,0.01898,0.00958,-0.0212,-0.014336,0.03134,-0.0064,0.03412,-0.01344,-0.05948,-0.02853,-0.03732,-0.0545,-0.02081,0.0133,0.02167,-0.02045,-0.04416,-0.0229,-0.01281,0.0397,-0.02173,-0.00825,0.00847,-0.01682,-0.01819,0.02148,0.02081,-0.04553,-0.0424,0.03842,0.04965,-0.003237,-0.01559,0.01334,0.00628,0.05527,0.02805,0.03702,-0.004173,-0.01088,0.010605,-0.02405,-0.009796,-0.02562,0.012375,0.04456,-0.013855,-0.02731,-0.01929,-0.02382,-0.0641,-0.00173,-0.02614,0.013306,0.02298,-0.02177,0.01476,0.0305,0.02502,-0.02052,0.0386,0.02101,0.01169,-0.02354,-0.003174,0.04562,0.0305,0.0082,0.034,-0.01772,0.01177,0.05,-0.002121,-0.001309,0.0262,0.02219,0.0371,-0.0262,-0.013794,-0.03354,0.03574,-0.03018,-0.00719,-0.03278,0.05594,0.01862,0.03513,0.00419,0.005688,0.001993,-0.02881,0.002878,-0.0401,-0.00959,0.02008,0.00592,-0.005234,-0.001126,0.00418,0.00913,-0.01591,-0.02887,0.0314,-0.027,0.01897,0.01595,0.03445,0.007072,0.0201,-0.01157,-0.03427,-0.01173,0.01797,-0.01179,-0.01108,0.01817,-0.003109,0.001257,-0.01089,-0.03406,-0.0069,0.003872,-0.001457,-0.003212,-0.002663,-0.05762,-0.006683,-0.007835,-0.002266,0.02505,0.02928,0.010765,-0.0488,-0.011024,0.01596,0.00828,-0.01364,-0.04184,-0.05856,0.0209,-0.00215,0.03265,-0.010155,-0.03995,0.04,0.01892,0.01749,-0.004192,-0.007374,-0.01697,0.01863,-0.006004,-0.039,-0.03094,0.03848,-0.0097,0.03946,-0.038,-0.01499,-0.01,-0.02266,0.02145,-0.02632,-0.01758,-0.02007,0.02722,0.03262,0.00879,0.003181,0.01744,-0.004696,-0.05646,-0.02098,0.02019,0.0107,0.00783,0.009544,-0.04648,-0.01168,-0.03012,0.04105,-0.01672,-0.01901,0.01082,-0.05658,0.01791,-0.04504,-0.0301,-0.014915,0.0673,-0.0445,-0.01005,0.0047,-0.03467,-0.007904,0.02702,0.00787,-0.05588,-0.05347,-0.05298,0.00445,-0.04846,0.04773,0.001165,-0.03387,0.05002,-0.06244,0.00736,0.02547,-0.0639,0.01826,-0.01003,-0.0815,0.03049,-0.012375,-0.03046,0.05084,-0.0315,-0.02512,0.00889,0.02596,0.005177,-0.01173,0.00789,-0.04013,0.01607,-0.01439,-0.03287,0.01396,-0.02379,-0.03094,-0.02985,-0.006287,-0.0625,-0.002766,-0.04272,-0.0004828,-0.02812,0.014114,-0.001794,-0.0233,-0.0428,0.002857,0.01485,0.00953,-0.0314,-0.01244,0.0177,0.03806,-0.06146,0.03021,-0.0241,-0.03073,0.03787,0.0319,0.00893,-0.02512,0.01901,-0.013535,-0.005463,-0.0751,0.012375,0.05658,0.0001284,0.001897,0.003914,-0.04,-5.79e-05,0.009415,-0.02208,-0.03174,-0.01115,0.02754,-0.01746,-0.03192,0.01569,0.006405,-0.03906,-0.01991,0.02

89,中国联通在浙江数字机关建设方面有哪些成果？,在助力政府运行整体效能提升上，中国联通协助浙江打造数字机关，构建一个政务“运行大脑”，服务“七个机关”，形成N个“机关应用”，打造出整体智治、高效协同的现代政府办公系统。浙江联通依托“浙渔安”数字系统，将“人民至上生命至上”的理念转化为实际行动。同时，联通数科还利用大数据、云计算等先进技术，对浙江省的经济运行、社会治理、公共服务等领域进行了全面分析，为政府决策提供了科学依据。咨询服务，还通过共建共享的方式，促进了政府数据资源的开放与利用。同中国联通在数字化转型方面的实践成果丰硕。通过加快推进数字化转型，中国联通以改革创新为动力，以集约化建设为契机，坚持推进核心技术自主化，向全面智能化方向演进。总之，浙江联通金华市分公司通过开展共产党员工程，充分发挥了“关键少数”的“头雁效应”，形成了推动公司高质量发展的中华民族伟大复兴的###梦贡献更大的力量。,"-0.01643,-0.003609,-0.0252,-0.03217,0.02696,0.05286,0.02039,-0.0284,-0.00816,0.02864,0.02625,0.02097,-0.01315,0.0004146,-0.015564,-0.001813,-0.01115,0.006645,0.0355,0.02847,0.01936,-0.0344,-0.02374,-0.02489,-0.01971,0.010635,-0.03394,-0.00423,0.0714,-0.03165,-0.03342,-0.01393,0.00936,0.06793,0.0218,0.010574,-0.0336,-0.002283,0.013145,-0.004406,0.01695,-0.002785,0.001471,-0.03796,-0.02599,0.06836,-0.03485,-0.02596,-0.004124,0.02917,-0.01633,0.02324,0.0636,0.02571,-0.0225,0.02663,-0.01274,-0.00713,-0.024,-0.027,-0.0079,0.1112,0.0093,-0.0313,-0.00299,0.0252,0.0228,-0.04883,0.07794,0.002666,-0.004154,-0.02293,-0.0542,0.02423,0.02917,0.00924,0.011215,-0.04614,-0.06805,0.06415,-0.01602,-0.04626,0.0673,0.007584,0.02997,-0.01764,0.046,0.4587,0.007626,-0.02708,-0.02214,0.002977,-0.02885,-0.01613,0.04837,-0.03793,0.01678,0.01127,0.01325,-0.03293,0.02397,-0.00797,-0.04565,0.006382,-0.01758,-0.001898,-0.04053,-0.01614,0.01302,0.02458,-0.00994,0.04266,-0.002672,0.01397,0.00961,0.001834,-0.05807,0.03186,-0.008446,-0.01485,-0.001313,0.02467,-0.005787,-0.02953,-0.013504,-0.01204,0.03278,-0.0614,0.01782,-0.009865,0.02974,-0.02533,0.03183,-0.011215,0.00817,0.003904,-0.0849,-0.03427,0.00959,0.0193,0.05038,-0.00788,-0.02145,0.02989,0.0196,0.012115,-0.03044,0.0444,-0.02303,0.00926,-0.013504,-0.02786,-0.004578,-0.00573,0.03326,0.00655,0.0113,0.03156,0.01055,0.003725,0.01643,0.02167,0.01898,-0.0155,-0.02682,0.0007205,-0.010185,-0.007965,-0.001629,0.00919,-0.0353,0.0237,-0.03705,-0.0199,-0.02774,-0.01591,0.0007906,0.01715,0.05573,0.03778,-0.01167,-0.02707,0.03265,0.007107,-0.0466,0.01406,0.01682,0.008705,0.02101,-0.02249,-0.0376,-0.04395,0.00282,0.05704,-0.02336,0.028,-0.0491,0.0531,-0.001892,0.03717,0.00116,-0.001609,-0.01929,-0.02075,0.00559,-0.004593,0.0005565,0.01204,0.01894,0.0322,-0.0057,0.02657,0.01698,0.00441,0.0194,-0.012276,-0.0639,0.02158,-0.01686,0.001496,0.03583,-0.003313,-0.01674,-0.02525,-0.01996,0.02014,0.002974,0.01045,-0.05994,0.01639,-0.009674,-0.0405,0.026,0.01316,0.02524,0.05423,-0.00644,-0.0355,-0.04434,-0.04904,-0.05774,-0.02744,0.03235,-0.01848,-0.01445,0.02853,-0.0304,-0.00995,0.014206,-0.00765,0.01135,-0.03616,-0.01223,-0.02162,0.01659,0.00518,-0.012085,-0.02011,-0.002708,0.01339,-0.0317,-0.066,-0.0156,-0.0004907,0.03735,0.03537,0.03497,0.01706,0.01473,0.00919,-0.013565,-0.01645,-0.04175,-0.02744,-0.03485,-0.0226,-0.03787,-0.02275,0.0003326,0.02383,-0.06012,-0.01402,-0.009796,-0.02927,0.0213,0.00155,-0.03198,0.013084,-0.03253,-0.0389,-0.005028,0.0409,-0.03833,-0.06946,0.01587,0.03485,0.03644,0.02719,0.04382,0.02298,0.04404,0.002804,0.0291,-0.005493,-0.003672,0.02846,0.003729,0.010315,-0.01257,0.0155,-0.003775,0.0097,0.0156,-0.01756,-0.03372,-0.00557,0.0368,0.01813,0.01747,-0.01135,0.0101,0.008026,-0.01826,0.00731,0.002913,-0.001656,0.01833,0.01588,-0.011856,0.04,0.02493,-0.010994,-0.01165,0.005627,-0.010895,0.0046,0.02695,0.01182,-0.01654,0.010216,0.0414,0.00963,0.0203,0.0087,0.01359,-0.009285,-0.00938,-0.03476,-0.03323,0.02954,-0.01707,0.02255,0.02116,-0.0338,-0.002432,-0.04852,0.03116,-0.000719,-0.03008,0.03238,0.006596,0.02188,-0.05893,-0.01968,0.02924,0.001583,-0.044,0.00964,-0.0632,-0.0003474,0.01462,0.03485,0.0359,0.04974,-0.01171,-0.03096,-0.02893,0.0308,-0.01179,-0.01831,0.03177,0.03662,0.008934,0.02538,-0.03656,-0.004227,0.0277,-0.02898,0.00655,0.00461,-0.03177,0.03026,0.005497,0.02408,-0.0538,0.02516,-0.015236,-0.02762,-0.01054,0.04434,0.02719,-0.0009637,-0.01595,-0.00932,0.02798,-0.00472,0.015114,0.01338,0.00677,-0.0009117,0.02765,-0.01162,-0.01069,-0.05026,-0.0237,0.0228,-0.01482,-0.006275,-0.02151,0.03513,0.007717,0.02434,-0.04898,-0.01366,-0.04166,0.01651,-0.002466,0.01445,-0.01307,-0.02582,0.01976,0.01353,0.00479,0.002926,-0.0068,-0.01701,-0.00814,0.01014,0.004925,0.00929,-0.005608,-0.01633,-0.02539,-0.02263,-0.01683,0.04498,-0.02286,-0.01009,-0.02286,0.01278,0.01628,-0.0174,-0.0264,0.003983,0.06128,-0.006832,-0.02232,0.01926,-0.027,0.01105,0.0139,-0.01334,-0.04044,-0.05267,-0.04483,0.002722,-0.02576,0.048,-0.007866,-0.00826,0.05383,-0.01994,0.03348,-0.002817,-0.0549,0.01637,-0.04953,-0.1091,0.0231,0.005234,-0.02492,0.01268,-0.03943,-0.014946,0.01988,0.01735,-0.004868,-0.0181,-0.009186,-0.02812,0.004013,-0.003647,-0.01421,0.02258,0.01538,-0.066,-0.05054,-0.03047,-0.06073,-0.01843,-0.0493,-0.000414,-0.04626,0.02858,0.00888,-0.00892,-0.03375,0.02014,-0.02486,0.01677,0.004715,-0.03555,-0.0189,0.02103,-0.04932,0.02118,0.01466,-0.002817,0.03546,0.0244,0.01193,-0.0296,0.005287,0.007416,0.004646,-0.04877,0.01913,-0.00869,-0.03848,-0.01545,-0.02132,0.00938,0.00978,-0.01564,0.005344,-0.057,0.01596,-0.01
