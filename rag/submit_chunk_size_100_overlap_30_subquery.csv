37,面对云南省临沧市临翔区圈内乡斗阁村发生的一起森林火灾，中国联通省分公司是如何行动的？,"面对如此严峻的情况，全省网络线上下联动，抽调65名党团员志愿者组成网络保障突击队，调派19台抢修专车、1台应急通信车、1台卫星通信车、10台便携油机以及多台卫星电话等应急物资，赶赴华容；到达灾区指定地点后，保障队伍克服重重困难，连夜奋战10多个小时，完成了堤坝沿线、华容安置点区域所有基站的软件扩容，抢通通信线路、机房恢复供电、开通卫星通信。
值得注意的是，中国联通在此基础上进一步突破创新，瞄准行业创新构建“军团”模式，面向属地创新成立产业互联网公司，同时强化省分公司内部科技创新职能设置。

69,国务院国资委党委举办党纪学习教育读书班的目的是什么？,"此次活动不仅是对习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想的深入贯彻，更是对习近平总书记关于加强党的纪律建设重要论述的积极响应，旨在通过扎实的党纪学习教育，推动国资央企实现高质量发展。

85,中国联通党员干部在主题教育中要把握什么总要求？,"
一、把“学”字贯穿主题教育全过程，以理论学习固本，锤炼对党忠诚的意志力，进一步强化使命担当
中国联通坚持把强化理论学习作为首要任务并贯彻主题教育始终，采用专题读书班、行动学习、专家辅导、专题党课、主题党日、理论学习中心组学习、“第一议题”等方式，组织党员干部读原著、学原文、悟原理，务求以学铸魂、以学增智、以学正风、以学促干。
中国联通将开展主题教育同贯彻落实习近平总书记重要指示批示精神和党中央决策部署结合起来，注重通过调查研究找准问题，通过解决关键问题推动高质量发展。

97,2017年5月，中国联通两度大幅降低国际漫游资费，两次分别以什么为主要特征？,"2017年5月以来，中国联通两度大幅降低国际漫游资费，5月1日是以“一带一路”方向资费大幅降价为中国联通在中国人出访热点地区（近150个国家和地区），推出了25元（55元）费用封顶/流量包天服务，含100MB（60MB）的高速流量和全天最高速率384kbps的常速流量，消除了天价流量费用风险，解决了客户放心用的问题。
